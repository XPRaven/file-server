This is just a basic NodeJS server for hosting video, books, and audio.
The files are displayed directly in the browser, meaning if the browser can read it, it can be displayed.
Videos belong into 4d, books into 3d, and audio into 2d.
The entire project is split into backend and frontend with raspi-web-f being the frontend and raspi-web-b being the backend (the names comes from this project originally being made for a Raspberry Pi).
